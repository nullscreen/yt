      # According to YouTube documentation, the value is an ISO 8601 duration
      # in the format PT#M#S, in which the letters PT indicate that the value
      # specifies a period of time, and the letters M and S refer to length in
      # minutes and seconds, respectively. The # characters preceding the M and
      # S letters are both integers that specify the number of minutes (or
      # seconds) of the video. For example, a value of PT15M51S indicates that
      # the video is 15 minutes and 51 seconds long.
      #
      # The ISO 8601 duration standard, though, is not +always+ respected by
      # the results returned by YouTube API. For instance: video 2XwmldWC_Ls
      # reports a duration of 'P1W2DT6H21M32S', which is to be interpreted as
      # 1 week, 2 days, 6 hours, 21 minutes, 32 seconds. Mixing weeks with
      # other time units is not strictly part of ISO 8601; in this context,
      # weeks will be interpreted as "the duration of 7 days". Similarly, a
      # day will be interpreted as "the duration of 24 hours".
      # Video tPEE9ZwTmy0 reports a duration of 'PT2S'. Skipping time units
      # such as minutes is not part of the standard either; in this context,
      # it will be interpreted as "0 minutes and 2 seconds".
